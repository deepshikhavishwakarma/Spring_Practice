The system should then display the player and team information using Spring's dependency injection features.

Requirements:
Create a Properties File:
Filename: player.properties
Content:
	player.id=1
	player.name=Dhoni

Attributes:
private int playerId;
private String playerName;
private int yearsNumber;
private String teamName;
Methods:
Getters and setters for all attributes.
Use @Component to make it a Spring-managed bean.
Use @PropertySource to specify the location of player.properties.
Use @Value to inject property values.

AppConfig Class:To configure Spring to scan for components and load the properties file.
Annotations: @Configuration, @ComponentScan, @PropertySource

PlayerService Class:
Purpose: To demonstrate the usage of Player.
Attributes:
private Player player; (Injected using @Autowired)
Methods:
void displayPlayerInfo(): Prints the player and team information using the properties.
